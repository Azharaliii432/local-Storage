Local Storage Authentication System

A simple front-end authentication system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on understanding and implementing Local Storage for managing user data.

This project includes:

Sign Up page

Login page

Dashboard page

No backend. No databases. Everything is handled using the browser’s Local Storage.

🚀 Project Purpose

This project was created to:

Learn how Local Storage works in JavaScript

Understand basic authentication flow (signup → login → dashboard)

Practice DOM manipulation and form handling

Build logic-focused functionality instead of UI-heavy designs

If you’re looking for JWT, encryption, or real security — this is not that. This is a learning project, and it owns that.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

Browser Local Storage

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure fundamentals.

⚙️ Features

User registration using Local Storage

User login validation

Dashboard access after successful login

Data persistence using Local Storage

Basic client-side form validation

Logout functionality (clears session data)

📂 How It Works

User signs up → data is stored in Local Storage

User logs in → credentials are verified from Local Storage

On success → user is redirected to the dashboard

Session data is maintained using Local Storage

Logout clears the stored session

Simple logic. Straightforward flow.

📌 Limitations (Read This)

❌ No backend

❌ No encryption (passwords are stored as plain text)

❌ Not secure for real-world use

✅ Meant only for learning and practice


📚 What I Learned

Practical use of Local Storage

Handling authentication logic on the client side

Structuring JavaScript for real use cases

Debugging logic issues instead of hiding behind frameworks

🧠 Future Improvements

Password hashing

Backend integration (Node.js / Firebase)

Proper authentication & authorization

Improved UI/UX

Session expiration handling
